# Exhibition Template

Welcome to the exhibition template! This is a template for creating digital exhibitions with IIIF support.

## About the template

This template gives you everything you need to create a professional online exhibition. It's built with Next.js and supports IIIF manifests, making it easy to display digital objects from museums and archives.

To get started with your own exhibition:

1. **Use this template** by clicking the "Use this template" button on [GitHub](https://github.com/uib-ub/exhibition-template)
2. **Create a new repository** from the template - you now have your own copy in your GitHub space
3. **Start a codespace** by clicking the "Code" button and then "Open in codespace"
4. **Change the _basePath_** in `next.config.ts` to your own repository name
5. **Update the content** in the `content/` folder
6. **Commit and push** your changes to your repository and see your exhibition live at `https://<your-repository-name>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`
