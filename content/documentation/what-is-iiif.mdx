# What is IIIF? A Simple Guide for Non-Technical Users

If you're working with digital exhibitions, you might have heard the term "IIIF" mentioned. Don't worry if it sounds technical - this guide will explain what it is and why it matters for your digital exhibition in simple terms.

## What Does IIIF Stand For?

**IIIF** stands for **International Image Interoperability Framework**. That's a mouthful, so let's break it down:

- **International** - It's used worldwide
- **Image** - It's about digital images and visual materials
- **Interoperability** - Different systems can work together
- **Framework** - It's a set of rules and standards

Think of IIIF as a **universal language for digital images** that allows different websites, applications, and institutions to share and display images in a consistent way.

## Why Should You Care About IIIF?

Imagine you're trying to share a high-resolution image of a medieval manuscript. Without IIIF, you might face these problems:

- **Large file sizes** that take forever to load
- **Poor quality** when zooming in
- **Incompatible formats** between different systems
- **Limited sharing options** between institutions

IIIF solves these problems by providing a standardized way to:
- **Serve images efficiently** at any size or zoom level
- **Share images seamlessly** between different platforms
- **Display images consistently** across various viewers
- **Preserve image quality** while optimizing for web delivery

## How IIIF Works: A Simple Analogy

Think of IIIF like a **smart image delivery system**:

### Traditional Image Sharing (Without IIIF)
Imagine you have a huge poster and want to show it to someone online:
- You'd have to scan the entire poster at high resolution
- Upload the massive file
- The viewer would download the entire file, even if they only want to see a small part
- Zooming would be limited or poor quality

### IIIF Image Sharing
With IIIF, it's like having a **smart poster system**:
- The poster is stored in a special format that can be "sliced" into pieces
- When someone wants to see a specific part, only that piece is sent
- They can zoom in to see tiny details without losing quality
- The system automatically optimizes the image size for their screen

## Key Benefits for Digital Exhibitions

### 1. Better User Experience
- **Fast loading** - Images load quickly, even on slow connections
- **Smooth zooming** - Users can examine fine details without waiting
- **Responsive design** - Images look great on phones, tablets, and computers

### 2. Professional Quality
- **High-resolution viewing** - Show the finest details of your objects
- **Consistent display** - Images look the same across different devices
- **Professional appearance** - Your exhibition looks polished and modern

### 3. Easy Sharing and Collaboration
- **Cross-institution sharing** - Link to images from other collections
- **Standardized format** - Works with many different exhibition platforms
- **Future-proof** - Your content will work with new technologies

## IIIF in Your Exhibition Template

The exhibition template you're using includes built-in IIIF support through the **Work component**. This means you can easily display IIIF-compatible images and objects in your exhibition.

### What This Means for You

When you use the Work component with a IIIF manifest, you get:
- **Automatic zoom viewer** - Visitors can examine details
- **Responsive design** - Works on all devices
- **Professional appearance** - Looks like a museum-quality display
- **Easy setup** - Just provide the IIIF manifest URL

## Common IIIF Sources

Many major cultural institutions now provide IIIF access to their collections:

- **Libraries**: British Library, Library of Congress, National Library of Norway
- **Museums**: The Met, Smithsonian, Rijksmuseum
- **Universities**: Stanford, Harvard, Yale
- **Archives**: National Archives, Vatican Library

## Getting Started with IIIF

### Finding IIIF Content

1. **Look for IIIF badges** on institutional websites
2. **Check collection pages** for "IIIF" or "Manifest" links
3. **Search IIIF registries** for available collections
4. **Contact institutions** to ask about IIIF access

### Identifying IIIF URLs

When looking for IIIF content, you'll encounter different types of URLs. Here's what to look for:

#### Manifest URLs (What You Need for the Work Component)

These are the main URLs you'll use in your exhibition. They typically end with `.json` and contain the word "manifest":

**Common patterns:**
- `https://example.com/iiif/manifest.json`
- `https://example.com/iiif/2/manifest.json`
- `https://example.com/iiif/3/manifest.json`
- `https://example.com/iiif/presentation/manifest.json`

**Real examples:**
- Bodleian Library: https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/manifest/60834383-7146-41ab-bfe1-48ee97bc04be.json
- University of Bergen Library: https://api.ub.uib.no/items/ubb-diplom-0034?as=iiif


#### Image URLs (Advanced)

These are for individual images within a manifest and typically contain image manipulation parameters:

**Pattern:** `https://example.com/iiif/2/image-id/region/size/rotation/quality.format`

**Example:** `https://example.com/iiif/2/abc123/full/800,/0/default.jpg`

*Note: You usually don't need these directly - the Work component handles them automatically when you provide a manifest URL.*

#### Collection URLs

These point to groups of related objects:

**Pattern:** `https://example.com/iiif/collection/collection-name.json`

**Example:** `https://example.com/iiif/collection/medieval-manuscripts.json`

### How to Test if a URL is IIIF-Compatible

1. **Copy the URL** from the institution's website
2. **Paste it in your browser** - it should show a JSON file (lots of text with brackets and quotes)
3. **Look for key terms** in the JSON like "manifest", "canvas", "image", or "@context"
4. **Try it in your Work component** - if it works, you'll see the object displayed

### Common Places to Find IIIF URLs

**On institutional websites, look for:**
- "IIIF" or "Manifest" buttons
- "View in IIIF Viewer" links
- "Export" or "Share" options that mention IIIF
- "API" or "Developer" sections

**Example institutional IIIF pages:**
- British Library: Look for "IIIF Manifest" links on individual item pages
- The Met: Check the "API" section for IIIF endpoints
- Stanford: Use their IIIF manifest browser
- National Library of Norway: Look for "IIIF" badges on collection items

### Using IIIF in Your Exhibition

Once you have a IIIF manifest URL, you can display it in your exhibition using the Work component:

```tsx
<Work manifest="https://example.com/iiif/manifest.json">
  <Work.Content>
    <Work.Description>
      This medieval manuscript from the 14th century contains...
    </Work.Description>
  </Work.Content>
</Work>
```

## Technical Details (Optional)

If you're curious about the technical side, IIIF consists of three main APIs:

1. **[Image API](https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/)** - Handles image delivery and manipulation
2. **[Presentation API](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/)** - Defines how objects are structured and described
3. **[Content Search API](https://iiif.io/api/search/2.0/)** - Enables searching within objects

But you don't need to understand these details to use IIIF effectively in your exhibition!
