# Getting Started with Your Exhibition Website

Welcome! This guide will help you create your own digital exhibition website using our GitHub template. We'll walk through the initial setup process step by step.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can delete the `content/documentation` folder and still read the documentation at [https://uib-ub.github.io/exhibition-template/documentation](https://uib-ub.github.io/exhibition-template/documentation).

## What is this template?

This is a **website template** specifically designed for creating digital exhibitions. Think of it like a pre-built website that you can customize with your own content - like a digital gallery or museum exhibit.

**Key features:**
- Display digital objects and images with zoom capabilities
- Create beautiful, professional-looking pages
- Easy to update and maintain
- Works on all devices (phones, tablets, computers)
- Free hosting on GitHub

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create Your Own Copy

1. **Click the "Use this template" button** on the GitHub page, https://github.com/uib-ub/exhibition-template
   - This creates your own personal copy of the template
   - It's like making a photocopy of a document - you get your own version to work with
   - You can also use this link: https://github.com/new?template_name=exhibition-template&template_owner=uib-ub

2. **Name your repository**
   - Choose a name that describes your exhibition (e.g., "medieval-manuscripts" or "my-art-exhibition")
   - This name will become part of your website's address

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**
    1. Go to the repository settings
    2. Click on "Pages"
    3. Change the source to "GitHub Action" under "Build and deployment"
    4. Save the changes

### Step 2: Open Your Workspace

1. **Start a codespace** by clicking the green "Code" button
2. **Select "Open in codespace"**
   - This opens a web-based editor where you can make changes
   - No need to install anything on your computer!

### Step 3: Configure Your Website

You need to tell the website what to call itself. Here's how:

1. **Find the configuration file** called `next.config.ts`
2. **Change the basePath** to match your repository name

For example, if your repository is called "my-art-exhibition", change this line:

```tsx filename="next.config.ts"
// ... existing code ...
basePath: "/exhibition-template",  // ← Change this line
// ... existing code ...
```

To:

```tsx filename="next.config.ts"
// ... existing code ...
basePath: "/my-art-exhibition",    // ← Your repository name here
// ... existing code ...
```

**What this does:** This tells the website what its "address" will be on the internet.

3. **Change the title**

To change the title of your website, edit the `title` property in the `metadata` object. For example, to change the title to "My Art Exhibition", change this line:

```tsx {2} filename="src/app/layout.tsx"
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Exhibition Template",
  description: "Coming soon",
};
```

Also change the `description` property to a short description of your exhibition. This will be shown in search engine results.

### Step 4: Add Your Content

The `content/` folder contains all your exhibition pages. Here's what you can edit:

- **`index.mdx`** - Your main homepage
- **`about.mdx`** - Information about your exhibition
- **`contact.mdx`** - How people can reach you
- **`theme/`** - Individual exhibition themes or sections

**How to edit content:**
- Click on any `.mdx` file in the `content/` folder
- Edit the text between the `---` markers at the top (this is called "frontmatter")
- Add your content below the frontmatter
- Use simple formatting like `**bold text**` or `# headings`

### Step 5: Publish Your Website

1. **Save your changes** in the codespace
2. **Commit your changes** - this is like saving a version of your work
3. **Push to GitHub** - this uploads your changes
4. **Wait a few minutes** for GitHub to build your website

Your exhibition will be live at: `https://[your-username].github.io/[your-repository-name]/`
