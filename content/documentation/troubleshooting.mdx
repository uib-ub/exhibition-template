# Troubleshooting Common Issues

This guide will help you solve common problems you might encounter while creating your exhibition website. Don't worry - most issues have simple solutions!

## My Website Isn't Working

### The website won't load or shows an error

**Possible causes and solutions:**

1. **Check your repository name**
   - Make sure you changed the `basePath` in `next.config.ts` to match your repository name
   - The name should be exactly the same (including hyphens and lowercase letters)

2. **Wait for GitHub to build your site**
   - After pushing changes, GitHub needs time to build your website
   - This usually takes 2-5 minutes
   - Check the "Actions" tab in your repository to see if the build is complete

3. **Check the URL format**
   - Your website should be at: `https://[your-username].github.io/[your-repository-name]/`
   - Make sure you're using the correct username and repository name

### The website loads but looks wrong

1. **Check your content files**
   - Make sure your `.mdx` files are in the `content/` folder
   - Verify the files have the correct extension (`.mdx`, not `.md`)
   - Check that you saved your changes

2. **Look for syntax errors**
   - Missing brackets `{}` or parentheses `()`
   - Unclosed quotes `"` or backticks `` ` ``
   - Extra or missing characters

## Content Issues

### My text isn't appearing on the page

**Check these common issues:**

1. **File location**
   - Make sure your file is in the `content/` folder
   - Check that the file has a `.mdx` extension

2. **File structure**
   - Make sure your file starts with frontmatter (the section between `---` markers)
   - Example:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: My Page Title
   ---
   
   # My Content Here
   ```

3. **Save your changes**
   - Make sure you saved the file after making changes
   - Commit and push your changes to GitHub

### Images aren't showing up

**Troubleshooting steps:**

1. **Check the file location**
   - Images must be in the `public/` folder
   - The path in your content should start with `/`

2. **Verify the file name**
   - Check for typos in the image filename
   - Make sure the file extension is correct (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.)
   - File names are case-sensitive

3. **Check the image format**
   - Use common formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
   - Make sure the file isn't corrupted

**Correct image syntax:**
```markdown
![Description of the image](/your-image-name.jpg)
```

### Links aren't working

**Common link problems:**

1. **External links**
   - Make sure the URL is complete (starts with `https://`)
   - Test the link in a new browser tab

2. **Internal links**
   - For pages within your exhibition, use relative paths
   - Example: `[About Us](/about)` not `[About Us](https://example.com/about)`

3. **Check for typos**
   - Verify the URL is spelled correctly
   - Make sure the page you're linking to exists

## Work Component Issues

### The Work component isn't displaying my object

**Check these settings:**

1. **Manifest ID**
   - Make sure the manifest ID or URL is correct

2. **Component syntax**
   - Verify all brackets and tags are properly closed
   - Make sure you imported the Work component

3. **Object availability**
   - Some objects might not be available for public viewing
   - Try a different object ID to test

### The zoom viewer isn't working

1. **Browser compatibility**
   - Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Make sure your browser is up to date

2. **Object format**
   - The object must be in IIIF format
   - Some objects might not support zoom functionality

## GitHub Issues

### I can't find the "Use this template" button

1. **Make sure you're on the right page**
   - You should be on the main repository page (https://github.com/uib-ub/exhibition-template)
   - Look for a green button that says "Use this template"

2. **Check your GitHub account**
   - You need to be logged into GitHub
   - Make sure you have a GitHub account

### I can't open a codespace

1. **Browser requirements**
   - Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Make sure JavaScript is enabled

2. **GitHub account settings**
   - Check that codespaces are enabled for your account
   - You might need to verify your email address

### Changes aren't appearing after I push

1. **Wait for the build**
   - GitHub needs time to rebuild your website
   - Check the "Actions" tab to see build progress

2. **Clear your browser cache**
   - Press Ctrl+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to refresh
   - Try opening the site in an incognito/private window

3. **Check the build logs**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Look for any error messages in the build logs

## Performance Issues

### The website is loading slowly

1. **Image file sizes**
   - Large images can slow down your website
   - Compress images to under 2MB each
   - Use WebP format when possible

2. **Number of images**
   - Too many images on one page can cause slow loading
   - Consider splitting content across multiple pages

3. **Browser cache**
   - Clear your browser cache
   - Try a different browser

## Getting Help

### When to ask for help

Ask for help when:
- You've tried the solutions above but the problem persists
- You get an error message you don't understand
- Something that should work isn't working

### How to ask for help effectively

When asking for help, include:
1. **What you're trying to do**
2. **What's happening instead**
3. **What you've already tried**
4. **Any error messages you see**
5. **Your repository name** (if relevant)

### Where to get help

1. **Check the documentation first**
   - Look for similar examples in the guides
   - Search for your specific issue

2. **Ask in the community**
   - Technical support forums (https://github.com/uib-ub/exhibition-template/discussions)
   - Colleagues or friends with technical experience

## Prevention Tips

### Save your work regularly

1. **Commit frequently**
   - Save your changes every few minutes
   - Use descriptive commit messages

2. **Test as you go**
   - Check your website after each major change
   - Don't wait until the end to test everything

3. **Keep backups**
   - Your work is automatically saved on GitHub
   - Consider keeping local copies of important content

### Start simple

1. **Begin with basic content**
   - Start with simple text pages
   - Add complex features gradually

2. **Test one thing at a time**
   - Make one change, test it, then move to the next
   - This makes it easier to identify problems

3. **Use examples**
   - Copy and modify existing examples
   - Don't try to write everything from scratch

## Common Error Messages

**What it means:** The page you're trying to access doesn't exist.

**Solutions:**
- Check the URL spelling
- Make sure the page file exists in the correct folder

### "Build failed"

**What it means:** GitHub couldn't build your website due to an error.

**Solutions:**
- Check the build logs in the "Actions" tab
- Look for syntax errors in your content
- Make sure all files are properly formatted
