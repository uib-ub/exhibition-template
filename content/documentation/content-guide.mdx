# Creating Content for Your Exhibition

This guide will help you write and organize content for your digital exhibition, even if you've never created a website before.

## Understanding Your Content Structure

Think of your exhibition website like a book with different chapters. Each file in the `content/` folder represents a page on your website.

### Main Pages

- **`index.mdx`** - Your homepage (the first page visitors see)
- **`about.mdx`** - Information about your exhibition or organization
- **`contact.mdx`** - How people can reach you
- **`documentation/`** - Help pages (you can delete this folder if you don't need it)

### Creating New Sections

You can create new folders for different parts of your exhibition:

import { FileTree } from 'nextra/components'

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="content" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    <FileTree.File name="about.mdx" />
    <FileTree.File name="contact.mdx" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="artifacts" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
      <FileTree.File name="artifact-1.mdx" />
      <FileTree.File name="artifact-2.mdx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="themes" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
      <FileTree.File name="medieval.mdx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Writing Your Content

### Basic Text Formatting

You can use simple formatting to make your text more readable:

```markdown
# Main Heading (largest)
## Section Heading
### Subsection Heading

**Bold text** for emphasis
*Italic text* for subtle emphasis

- Bullet points
- For lists
- Of items

1. Numbered lists
2. For steps
3. Or sequences

[Link text](https://example.com) for external links
```

### Adding Images

To add images to your exhibition:

1. **Upload your image** to the `public/` folder
2. **Reference it** in your content like this:

```markdown
![Description of the image](/your-image-name.jpg)
```

**Tips for images:**
- Use descriptive file names (e.g., `medieval-manuscript-001.jpg`)
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 2MB for web)
- Use common formats: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Include alt text for accessibility

### Creating Links Between Pages

Link to other pages in your exhibition:

```markdown
[View our artifacts](/artifacts)
[Learn more about medieval manuscripts](/themes/medieval)
[Contact us](/contact)
```

## Using the Work Component

The Work component is perfect for displaying digital objects that are published as IIIF manifests ([What is IIIF?](/documentation/what-is-iiif)).

### Basic Work Component

```tsx
<Work manifest="https://api.ub.uib.no/items/ubb-diplom-0034?as=iiif">
  <Work.Content>
    <Work.Description>
      Describe your object here. What is it? When was it made? 
      Why is it important to your exhibition?
    </Work.Description>
    <Work.Link href="https://example.com/more-info">
      Learn more about this object
    </Work.Link>
  </Work.Content>
</Work>
```

### Example

<Work manifest="https://api.ub.uib.no/items/ubb-diplom-0034?as=iiif">
  <Work.Content>
    <Work.Description>
      Describe your object here. What is it? When was it made? 
      Why is it important to your exhibition?
    </Work.Description>
    <Work.Link href="https://example.com/more-info">
      Learn more about this object
    </Work.Link>
  </Work.Content>
</Work>

### Writing Good Descriptions

**Do:**
- Explain what the object is
- Provide historical context
- Mention why it's significant
- Use clear, accessible language

**Example:**
```
This 14th-century manuscript contains the earliest known recipe for 
medieval ink making. The text, written in Latin, provides detailed 
instructions for creating writing materials used by scribes throughout 
the Middle Ages. This document is particularly important because it 
shows the transition from expensive imported inks to locally-produced 
alternatives.
```

**Don't:**
- Use overly technical language
- Assume prior knowledge
- Write overly long descriptions
- Forget to explain why it matters

## Using the Quote Component

The Quote component is perfect for displaying quotes from your exhibition.

### Basic Quote Component

```tsx
<Quote>
  Your quote text here
</Quote>
```

### Quote with Source

```tsx
<Quote>
  Your quote text here
  <Quote.Source>
    — Author Name, [Source](https://example.com)
  </Quote.Source>
</Quote>
```
### Example

<Quote>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
  <Quote.Source>
    — Author Name, [Source](https://example.com)
  </Quote.Source>
</Quote>

## Organizing Your Content

### Planning Your Exhibition Structure

Before you start writing, plan your exhibition structure:

1. **Main theme** - What is your exhibition about?
2. **Sections** - How will you organize the content?
3. **Individual items** - What specific objects or topics will you feature?
4. **Flow** - How should visitors navigate through your exhibition?

### Example Exhibition Structure

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="Medieval Manuscripts Exhibition" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="Introduction (index.mdx)" />
    <FileTree.File name="About the Collection (about.mdx)" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="Manuscript Types" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="Religious Texts" />
      <FileTree.File name="Scientific Works" />
      <FileTree.File name="Literary Manuscripts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="Featured Objects" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="The Book of Hours" />
      <FileTree.File name="Medical Treatise" />
      <FileTree.File name="Poetry Collection" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="Contact Information (contact.mdx)" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

I've converted the example exhibition structure from a markdown code block to the FileTree component. This will:

1. **Show the exhibition structure as an interactive tree** that users can navigate
2. **Display the hierarchy clearly** with proper folder and file icons
3. **Allow users to expand/collapse sections** to focus on specific parts
4. **Make it easier to understand** how the content is organized

The structure now shows:
- The main exhibition folder
- Individual pages (Introduction, About, Contact)
- Two main sections (Manuscript Types and Featured Objects) with their respective items
- All folders are set to `defaultOpen` so users can see the full structure immediately

### Creating Navigation

Help visitors find their way around your exhibition:

1. **Add navigation links** to your pages
2. **Use consistent headings** throughout
3. **Include "back to top" links** on long pages
4. **Create breadcrumbs** for complex sections

## Writing for the Web

### Keep It Scannable

Web readers scan content rather than read word-for-word:

- **Use short paragraphs** (2-3 sentences max)
- **Include subheadings** to break up text
- **Use bullet points** for lists
- **Highlight key information** with bold text

### Make It Accessible

- **Use descriptive headings** that explain the content
- **Write clear link text** (avoid "click here")
- **Provide alt text** for images
- **Use simple language** and avoid jargon

### Optimize for Different Devices

- **Keep paragraphs short** for mobile reading
- **Use clear, readable fonts** (the template handles this)
- **Test your content** on different screen sizes

## Content Best Practices

### Before You Start Writing

1. **Define your audience** - Who is this exhibition for?
2. **Set clear goals** - What do you want visitors to learn?
3. **Research your topic** - Gather accurate information
4. **Plan your structure** - Organize your thoughts

### While Writing

1. **Start with an outline** - Plan your content structure
2. **Write in plain language** - Avoid unnecessary complexity
3. **Include examples** - Help readers understand concepts
4. **Add visual elements** - Images, diagrams, or interactive components

### After Writing

1. **Review for accuracy** - Check your facts
2. **Edit for clarity** - Remove unnecessary words
3. **Test your links** - Make sure they work
4. **Get feedback** - Ask others to review your content

## Common Content Types

### Exhibition Introduction

Your homepage should:
- Welcome visitors
- Explain what the exhibition is about
- Provide an overview of what they'll see
- Include a call-to-action

### Object Descriptions

When describing artifacts:
- What is it?
- When was it made?
- Who made it?
- Why is it important?
- What can we learn from it?

### Educational Content

For educational exhibitions:
- Start with the basics
- Build complexity gradually
- Include examples and context
- Provide additional resources

### Contact Information

Make it easy for people to reach you:
- Clear contact details
- Multiple ways to get in touch
- Response time expectations
- Professional but friendly tone

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

See [Troubleshooting Guide](/documentation/troubleshooting) for common issues.

## Getting Help

If you're stuck:
1. **Check the documentation** - Look for similar examples
2. **Start simple** - Begin with basic text and add complexity later
3. **Ask for help** - Don't hesitate to reach out for assistance
4. **Take breaks** - Sometimes stepping away helps clarify your thoughts
